# Detailed Plan
- Introduction
1. A UAV fleet designed to operate autonomously to detect targets.
2. Capable of flying over grassy land and navigating through different terrains (land, water, air).
3. Utilizes swarm technology for communication and coordination.

- Methodology
1. Each drone will be equipped with a flight controller, LiDAR sensor, and color sensor.
2. The drones will communicate using ESP8266 modules (simulated for virtual testing).
3. The drones will be programmed to avoid collisions and identify targets based on specified criteria.

-System Design
1. Drones will have a robust design to handle different terrains.
2. The system will initiate an open field test flight using a remote control.
