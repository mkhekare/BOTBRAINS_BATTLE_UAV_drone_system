a) Understanding Swarm Drones
Swarm drones are a group of drones that operate together to accomplish a common goal. They communicate and coordinate with each other, mimicking the behavior of natural swarms like bees or birds. Key features include:
•	Decentralized Control: No single drone controls the swarm; each drone follows simple rules and makes decisions based on local information and communication with nearby drones.
•	Scalability: Swarm systems can easily be scaled up by adding more drones without significant changes to the underlying control algorithms.
•	Redundancy: The failure of one or a few drones does not affect the overall mission, as other drones can compensate for the loss.
