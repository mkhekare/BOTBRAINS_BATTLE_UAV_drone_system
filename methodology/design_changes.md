## Design Changes in Regular Drones
# To adapt a regular drone for operation on land, air, and water,(Amphibious) the following changes can be made:
1.	Multi-Terrain Mobility:
-	Landing Gear: Equip drones with retractable landing gear that can function as wheels for land movement.
-	Buoyant Design: Use waterproof materials and a buoyant design to ensure drones can float and move on water surfaces.
2.	Enhanced Sensors:
-	LiDAR Sensors: Improve obstacle detection and measurement accuracy. LiDAR provides precise distance measurements, crucial for identifying objects and avoiding collisions in different environments.
-	Color Sensors: Use high-resolution color sensors to accurately detect target colors, ensuring reliable identification of specified targets.
3.	Improved Communication:
-	Swarm Technology: Integrate robust swarm communication protocols (e.g., ZigBee, LoRa) for reliable inter-drone communication over longer distances.
-	Redundant Communication Links: Implement multiple communication channels to ensure reliability even if one channel fails.
4.	Battery Efficiency:
-	High-Capacity Batteries: Use high-capacity, lightweight batteries to extend flight time and range.
-	Energy Management System: Implement an efficient power management system to optimize battery usage.
5.	Durable Build:
-	Weatherproofing: Ensure the drone is resistant to various weather conditions, enabling operation in different environments.
-	Robust Materials: Use durable and lightweight materials for the drone frame to enhance longevity and performance.
