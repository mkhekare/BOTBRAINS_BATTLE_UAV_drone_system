## Communication using ESP8266
The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module can establish a mesh network for drone-to-drone communication. Drones can send messages about their status and findings to each other.
### Following steps can be used to integrate ESP8266 Wi-Fi module with the flight controller for communication:
1.	Hardware Connection:
-	Connect the ESP8266 to the flight controller using serial communication (UART).
-	Ensure proper power supply (3.3V) and ground connections.
2.	Firmware Configuration:
-	Flash the ESP8266 with appropriate firmware (e.g., AT firmware or a custom firmware like NodeMCU).
-	Configure the flight controller to communicate with the ESP8266 via UART.
3.	Communication Protocol:
-	Implement a communication protocol (e.g., MQTT, HTTP) to exchange data between drones.
-	Use the ESP8266 to connect to a Wi-Fi network and send/receive data.
4.	Software Integration:
-	Write code for the flight controller to process the data received from the ESP8266.
-	Use the received data for navigation, target identification, and swarm coordination.
